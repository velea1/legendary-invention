                            to other courses in the studentâ€™s selected track of study. The course is experiential in nature i.e. the student
                            will be required to produce results for use by real individuals and will be evaluated both on process and product.
                            In addition to prerequisites, a second level programming course with a grade of C or better, and Senior level standing
                            is required. This is a writing-intensive course. Note: Students cannot get credit for BSC 430 and 430W; BCS 430W can be
                            used to ful ll the writing intensive requirement.  Note: Offered at the discretion of the Computer Programming and Info
